# Purged K-Fold Cross-Validation Configuration
# Prevents data leakage through temporal purging and embargo

validation:
  type: PurgedKFold
  n_splits: 5  # 5-fold cross-validation

  embargo_days: 21  # 21-day embargo after test set

  # Ensures no overlap between training and test sets
  # Critical for time-series financial data
